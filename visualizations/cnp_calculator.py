"""
have radio buttons at the top to pick what type of option to price
given different button different left sides should be used to allow different inputs 
for instance binomial needs trials n where black-scholes does not
i need to think about encapsulating this in a seperate program so that i can use it for all my cnp visualizations
once inputs are given and validated then i can just use pyplot to make whatever i want
